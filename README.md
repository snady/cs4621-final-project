Weather Based Scene Renderer

Notes/Bugs: There is still strange behavior if you resize the canvas while the program is running, but refreshing the page will easily fix the behavior. So we just recommend not resizing while the page is already loaded. Additionally, the camera is bounded by the water (so you can't go underwater at the moment), but that means you also can't move forward "w" while at water level so we recommend elevating the camera a little, then moving forward (space to elevate). We hope you enjoy this as much as we do, thanks!
